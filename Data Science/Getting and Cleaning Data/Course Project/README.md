##Files (repo)

<b>The code uses all the data present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered. -> Folder containing the train and test folders should be 'UCI HAR Dataset'</b>

CodeBook.md describes the steps taken to perform the tasks assigned in the project: gathering and loading data, translation of the data, cleaning of the data and explanation of the variables used through the project.

run_analysis.R script contains the code to perform the tidying of the data.

The cleaned dataset with the proper averages for the activities per subject was exported into the uploaded avg_data.txt file in table format without column headers.
